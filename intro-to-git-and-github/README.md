# Basic Commands 1

1. Initialize a repository *Run this **ONLY ONCE***: 
```git init```

2. Check the status of the repository: 
```git status```

3. Add file(s) to the staging area
    * For individual files: ```git add <filename>``` 
    * For all files: ```git add .```

4. Commit changes (Take a screenshot of code): 
```git commit -m "Initial Commit"```

5. List out all the commits: 
```git log```

6. Check the difference between file changes: 
```git diff```

7. List out all the branches: 
```git branch```

8. Create a new branch: 
```git branch <branch_name>```

9. Merge other branches with master branch: 
```git merge master <branch_to_be_merged>```

# Activity 1

1. Create a new branch
2. Add two commits in that branch
3. Merge with master

# Basic Commands 2

1. List out all the remotes: ```git remote```
2. Add remote to current repository: 
```git remote add <remote name> <github link>```
3. Long list remotes:
```git remote -v```
4. Push local to changes to master branch of origin remote: ```git push -u origin master```

# Activity 2

1. Make a lot of changes in the master branch
2. Add, commit, push 
3. See the output on github

# Activity 3

Create a file called .gitignore in the root

1. Use any existing node/react app
2. Init, add, commit
3. Ignore relevant files (Eg: Node modules)
4. Push to github

# Activity 4

1. Find out the difference between (locally)
    * clone from dctacademy
    * clone from your account
2. Use these tools to understand
    * branch
    * remote
    * commits
3. Create a new node/react app and push to github

# Activity 5
1. Create a new repo on github - sample-mern
2. Create a new node app - local machine
3. Create a new react app - local machine 
4. Inside the node app, create a new folder called
"client"
5. Copy contents of the new react app into the client folder

or

- Run create-react-app in node app and call it 'client'
6. Go inside the client folder and remove .git file
(Command to remove .git: rm -rf .git)
(For Windows: rmdir /a .git)
7. Ignore relevant files in - node app - .gitignore should
be at the root of node app

# Basic Commands 3

1. Add an upstream remote: ```git remote add upstream ```<admin-repo-link> 

2. Pull changes from the admin repo to your local repo: 
```git pull upstream master```

# Danger Commands

1. Undo latest commit (Only local): 
```git revert HEAD```

2. Destroy all exisiting changes: 
```git checkout .```

3. **Stash:** Keep temprary copy of current changes without a commit
    * Stash current changes: ```git stash```
    * Pop lastest stash: ```git stash pop```
    * List all stashes: ```git stash show```
    * List stash with changes:```git stash show -p```
    
## GitHub CLI

```gh``` is GitHub on the command line, and itâ€™s now available in beta. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code.

## Usage

### Commands
To view detail on any command, use gh [command] [subcommand] --help

- ```gh issue [status, list, view, create]```
- ```gh pr [status, list, view, checkout, create]```
- ```gh repo [clone, create, fork, view]```
- ```gh config [get, set]```
- ```gh help```

### Global flags

```
      --help              Show help for command
